# How to use internet safely?

Internet is a very interesting place. You can find good or bad thing according to your interest. But there are some entities out there who will exploit you and your privacy legally or un-legally.

To protect your self consider following.
* Use VPN or [TOR](https://www.torproject.org/){: target="_blank"} network always
* Aware yourself with UX dark patterns see [uxp2](https://darkpatterns.uxp2.com/){: target="_blank"} or [darkpatterns](https://darkpatterns.org/){: target="_blank"} or [Harry Brignull](https://90percentofeverything.com/){: target="_blank"}
* If sites are asking your consents about cookie policy (only provide for necessary cookies)
* Don't use login with social (e-g google, facebook, github, microsoft etc) Because if you do then these companies will track you
